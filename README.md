# grunt-onesky-import

> Import translation files into your OneSky project

## Getting Started
This plugin requires Grunt `~0.4.5`

If you haven't used [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) before, be sure to check out the [Getting Started](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started) guide, as it explains how to create a [Gruntfile](http://gruntjs.com/sample-gruntfile) as well as install and use Grunt plugins. Once you're familiar with that process, you may install this plugin with this command:

```shell
npm install grunt-onesky-import --save-dev
```

Once the plugin has been installed, it may be enabled inside your Gruntfile with this line of JavaScript:

```js
grunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-onesky-import');
```

## The "oneskyImport" task

### Overview
In your project's Gruntfile, add a section named `oneskyImport` to the data object passed into `grunt.initConfig()`.

IMPORTANT:

* Your translation file should include translation strings in the base language set up in your OneSky project.
* After a successful upload, translations strings may not be immediately available in your project as they are automatically queued to be imported. This process can take a few seconds/minutes dependent on server load.

### Options

#### options.authFile
Type: `String`
Default value: `onesky.json`

A JSON file with your OneSky API keys.
```
{
    "publicKey": "YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY",
    "secretKey": "YOUR_SECRET_KEY"
}
```

#### options.projectId
Type: `String`

Your OneSky project ID

#### options.file
Type: `String`

The path to the translation file to be upload to your OneSky project.

#### options.files
Type: `Array of Object`

```
[{
    ProjectId : String, locale : 'String', file : 'String'
}, {...}]
```

This list enable you to upload multiple file at a time. Note that you don't need to enter a value for the ProjectId, the locale or the file if you use the Array files. If you do use both at the same time the value you enter for the ProjectId, the locale and the file will add as an additionnal object of the Array files.

#### options.locale
Type: `String` Default value: Your project main language

The language (and region if specified) of your file. For example, you will use `en-GB` if you want to upload a file in english especially for Great Britain.

#### options.fileFormat
Type: `String`

The file format for OneSky to assume when importing translations. See list of available [file formats](https://github.com/onesky/api-documentation-platform/blob/master/reference/format.md).

#### options.isKeepingAllStrings (optional)
Type: `String`
Default value: `true`

When uploading a file which overwrites an existing file in your OneSky project, set this value to `false` to deprecate strings that cannot be found in the existing file. Files with different file names will not be overwritten or deprecate previous strings.

### Usage Examples

To upload one file :
```js
grunt.initConfig({
    oneskyImport: {
        options: {
            authFile: 'onesky.json',
            projectId: '12345',
            isKeepingAllStrings: false
        },
        import: {
            options: {
                locale: 'en-GB',
                file: 'media.json',
                fileFormat: 'HIERARCHICAL_JSON'
            }
        }
    },
});
```

To upload several file :
```js
grunt.initConfig({
    options: {
        authFile: 'onesky.json',
        projectId: '12345',
        isKeepingAllStrings: false
    },
    import: {
        files: [{ProjectId : '1234', locale : 'fr-FR', file : 'fr.json'},
        {ProjectId : '1234', locale : 'en-GB', file : 'en.json'}]
    }
})

```
